# Orivault

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Orivault** provided by [Oritude](www.oritude.com)! This repository is designed to foster collaboration, transparency, and shared learning within the Oritude community. It aggregates financial research tools and frameworks, empowering individuals to analyze, refine, and share insights.

## Features
- **Transparency**: All research code is community-reviewed to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Collaboration**: Contributions are encouraged to build a repository that grows through shared learning.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for developers and researchers of all levels to explore, contribute, and benefit from the collective knowledge.

## File Structure
Each of the different studies has its own dedicated folder. Inside each of them there is are several jupyter notebooks
for your reference and studies along with required classes to make the notebook run. Additionally there are a number
of classes that are used across each of the studies. We recommend looking through the common folders and understanding the 
purpose of each one.

### Configure Environment Variables
To securely store and manage your API keys, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project’s root directory.
2. Add the required secrets to the `.env` file. Here’s an example structure:
   ```plaintext
   # Environment Variables
   MONGOKEY=        # Your MongoDB connection string (optional)
   TIINGOKEY=       # Your Tiingo API key
   FREDKEY=         # Your FRED API key
   POLYGONKEY=      # Your Polygon.io API key

### Downloading required data locally
Each of these studies require data that is stored locally to run. The reason we store data locally is to reduce strain on our data providers and allow for easy access to our required data during studies.

1. Look through the data_extraction_scripts folder and understand the purpose of each data extraction script. Alternatively copy paste this bad boy into your terminal.
    ```bash
    cd data_extraction_scripts
    ./extract.sh
---

### Storing SEC Financial Statment Files
This data set is only required for the financial statement study
1. Create a folder called "sec" in the root folder of the repository
    ```bash
    mkdir sec
2. Download as my quarterly files from [SEC Financial Statement Files](https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/financial-statement-data-sets) as you want and move them to the sec file
3. Unzip each file keeping the name of the extract folder to be the same as the zip file name just without the zip. Example:
    ```plaintext
    2025q2.zip ~~ 2025q2

# You are ready!

We recommend that you look through the **common** and **financial_common** to have a better understanding of the global classes we provide. From there take a look at **financial_statement_study** to get started with your studies! Best of luck from **Oritude**
